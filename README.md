# TimGreen.ws Version 2.0
The brand new site for myself.

I've moved away from having jQuery and having some good old vanilla JS functionalities. I used Sass for styling and converted nearly all images from jpg to WebP. 

Nearly every bit of code and elements been optimised and minified to help achieve the 100/100 performance score.
