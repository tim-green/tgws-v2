					<p>I'm a web developer with a passion for strong, simple websites. I have 13 years of experience working in both an advertising agency and freelance capacity, mainly focusing on building websites and web applications which are simple to use and look great. </p>

					<p> I've worked with some great agencies, government organisations, individuals and start-ups to their reach both business and website goals. My approach is realistic and creative, supported by skills in web development such as using <span class="skill">HTML</span>, <span class="skill">CSS/Sass</span>, <span class="skill">PHP</span>, <span class="skill">JavaScript/jQuery</span> and along with using frameworks like <span class="skill">Bootstrap</span>.</p>

					<p> I have experience using <span class="skill">WordPress</span>, <span class="skill">Drupal</span>, <span class="skill">Shopify</span> and <span class="skill">WooCommerce</span>, and I can also create Accessible PDF and Word Documents. And even can create and manage email campaigns using <span class="skill">MailChimp</span>.</p>
					
					<p>I also have experience with the design and video software from <span class="skill">Adobe Creative Cloud</span>. I use <span class="skill">GruntJS</span> to automatically perform frequent tasks that I use on a daily when building websites and while using <span class="skill">GitHub</span> and <span class="skill">Fork Git Client</span> to help with versioning control my code.</p>
